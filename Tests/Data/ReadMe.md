This dacpac file is a very simple database that has just a couple of objects.

It is intended to provide the bones of what might be a tolerable workflow.

The .SQL in this folder was used to create the database which was the source for this dacpac file.

I think that the first (and, so far only) time I exported the dacpac file I used a GUI tool like SSMS. If I were to do this again,
I would write a small .ps1 file that used the DbaTools' Export dacpac package functionality.

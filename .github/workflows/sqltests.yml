      # Setting 'trusted' was recommended by @potatoqualitee in a YouTube talk I watched 2021/07/30.
      # I need a command to 'run stuff on SQL', I originally choose microsoft\sqlserver\invoke-sqlcmd even though sqlcollaborative\invoke-sqlcmd2\invoke-sqlcmd2 is better.
      # Maybe sqlserver isn't available. The docs I've read indicate that it would be, but when this ran, the log said that it couldn't find Invoke-Sqlcmd.
      # I'll try installing invoke-sqlcmd2 and using that, instead.
      #
      # do I need to build a $Credential using sa and the password from then environment?
